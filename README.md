## Background 
This started with the Home Assistant Forum thread, regarding Arctic SPA API

https://community.home-assistant.io/t/jacuzzi-arctic-spas-api/464596

It might get it's own thread

## Preface

This is boilerplate code for accessing Arctic Spa's and derivatives with python 3.8

Feel free to test it with your own spa, it should at this stage only provide info, so it should be fairly safe to use

## Requirements
Python 3.8 (or above)

pip install protobuf==5.28.2

## Usage
python SpaBoii.py

This should locate the SPA on your network and provide basic info

(If it does nothing, add your spa ip directly in the code instead)

REMEMBER: This is boilerplate code, meant to provide a basic codebase for communication with Arctic SPA's

SO USE AT OWN RISK, I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ERRORS THIS MIGHT CAUSE
